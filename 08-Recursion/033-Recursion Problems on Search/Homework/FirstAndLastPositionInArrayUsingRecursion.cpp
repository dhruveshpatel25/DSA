/*First and Last Position of an Element In Sorted Array
Problem statement
You have been given a sorted array/list 'arr' consisting of ‘n’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘k’.
Now, your task is to find the first and last occurrence of ‘k’ in 'arr'.
Note :
1. If ‘k’ is not present in the array, then the first and the last occurrence will be -1. 
2. 'arr' may contain duplicate elements.

Example:
Input: 'arr' = [0,1,1,5] , 'k' = 1
Output: 1 2
Explanation:
If 'arr' = [0, 1, 1, 5] and 'k' = 1, then the first and last occurrence of 1 will be 1(0 - indexed) and 2.
